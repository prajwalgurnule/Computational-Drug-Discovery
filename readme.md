## 🚀 Project Overview

This project contains several key components to support drug discovery efforts:

- **🔬 Drug Activity Prediction**: A machine learning model trained on ChEMBL data to predict the biological activity of potential drugs. It identifies critical properties for drug effectiveness.
- **⚛️ Drug Target Affinity Prediction**: Using clustering algorithms, the model predicts drug binding affinity scores, aiding pharmaceutical scientists in designing effective drugs.
- **💻 Drug Filtering with Lipinski’s Rule**: A Streamlit web app that filters FDA-approved drugs based on Lipinski's rule of five, a key guideline in drug discovery.
